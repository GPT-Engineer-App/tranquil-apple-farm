# tranquil-apple-farm

I want you to design a website for an apple farm located in Norway, emphasizing visual and textual presentation of the farm itself. The website should include the following pages: Home, About Us, Our Apples, Gallery, and Contact Us. The Home page should feature a large, welcoming photo of the farm with a brief introduction. The About Us page will provide detailed information about the farm's history and its unique qualities. The Our Apples page should describe the different varieties of apples grown, their taste profiles, and their harvest seasons. The Gallery should showcase high-quality images of the orchards, the harvesting process, and the scenic surroundings. The Contact Us page should offer a simple form for inquiries along with contact information. Ensure the design is clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing, reflecting the natural beauty and tranquility of the farm. There should be no e-commerce features as the site will not host a shop.
